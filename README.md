HighRes Vision
Overview
HighRes Vision is an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) designed to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image super-resolution tasks.

Features
Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs): Enhances the model's capacity to learn complex features.
Mixed Precision Training: Optimizes performance and reduces training time.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for performance evaluation.
Dataset: Trained and evaluated on the DIV2K dataset.

Installation
To get started with HighRes Vision, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

Copier
