***SuperRes Enhancer***

***Overview:***


HighRes Vision is an Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) designed to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in image super-resolution tasks.

***Features:***

***Residual Dense Blocks (RDBs):*** Enhances the model's capacity to learn complex features.

***Mixed Precision Training:*** Optimizes performance and reduces training time.

***Evaluation Metrics:***Uses Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for performance evaluation.

***Dataset:*** Trained and evaluated on the DIV2K dataset.

***Installation***
To get started with HighRes Vision, follow these steps:
